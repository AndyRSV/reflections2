How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It allows me to see what’s been added or remove from both files

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It will allow me to come back to earlier versions of the file if something happen

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

   Pros: we are in a better position to know if the changes are worth a saved and not creating multiples useless files

   Cons: We tend to forget when to save then risking to loose data

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log to see all the commits and comments
    git diff to compare two different commits and find whats been added and removed

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    While using git checkout (commit id) we can be sure that we can go from an old version of the game to a newer one. If it doesn’t work out we can always go back to the most recent commit. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

   I want to use to every thing related on version_control and other git tasks
